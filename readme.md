## Multiple Google Chrome Profiles

When multiple `google-chrome` Profiles created, you probably need to re-login google account if a Profile has been used for a certain time.

This script aims to run once and terminate `google-chrome` after 5 seconds for each profile.

```bash
chmod +x run-once.sh
./run-once.sh
```
